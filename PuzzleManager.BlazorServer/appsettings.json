{ // "ConnectionStrings" is a section that holds all named connection strings for the application.
  "ConnectionStrings": {

    // Breakdown of the connection string:
    //   Server=(local)\SQLEXPRESS
    //       - Points to a local SQL Express instance. 
    //       - In PRODUCTION, you might change this to "Server=yourproductionserver.domain,1433" or an Azure SQL name.
    //
    //   Database=PuzzleManager
    //       - The database name. In PRODUCTION, you might rename this to "PuzzleManagerProd" or something more appropriate.
    //
    //   Trusted_Connection=True
    //       - Uses Windows Authentication (integrated security). 
    //       - In PRODUCTION, you may switch to SQL Authentication (User ID/Password) or an Azure-managed identity.
    //
    //   Encrypt=True
    //       - Ensures the connection is encrypted. 
    //       - This is recommended for PRODUCTION to secure data in transit.
    //
    //   TrustServerCertificate=True
    //       - In DEV, this bypasses certificate validation for self-signed or untrusted certs.
    //       - In PRODUCTION, you should have a trusted certificate and set this to "False."
